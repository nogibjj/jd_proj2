# Project 2 

My project 2 will be a microservice that provides details on specific NBA teams/players using [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), an API client for the official NBA website. 

Specific details to come, but there will be different endpoints that provides information accordingly

Goal is to deploy it on Kubernetes / AWS.
